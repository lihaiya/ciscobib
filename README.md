Telephone terminal streaming recording, such as BIB recording supported by Cisco IP phone system:

Since most Cisco IP phones support BIB function, the so-called BIB function is that when Cisco IP phones are on a call, they send their incoming and outgoing traffic to the voice gateway, and then pass it to the PSTN external landline (internal and external call recording) or landline user (internal call recording), while copying their incoming and outgoing traffic to the recording server, thereby realizing call recording.

At this time, the recording software is located in the server that is interconnected with the IP phone network and the CUCM network, and can receive the traffic sent by the IP phone for recording.
